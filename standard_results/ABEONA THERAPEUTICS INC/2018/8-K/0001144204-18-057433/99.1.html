Worldwide Exclusive Licenses for the Treatment of Four Rare Lysosomal Storage Disorders Using NAV AAV9 Vector</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; background-color: white">ROCKVILLE, Md. and NEW YORK,&nbsp;Nov.
5, 2018&nbsp;(PRNEWSWIRE) --&nbsp;REGENXBIO Inc.&nbsp;(Nasdaq:RGNX), a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to
improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy based on its proprietary NAV<SUP>&reg;</SUP>&nbsp;Technology Platform,
and Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: ABEO), a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel cell
and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases, today announced a license agreement to REGENXBIO&rsquo;s NAV AAV9
vector for the treatment of four diseases: Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA), Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB), Infantile
Batten Disease, also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 1 (CLN1 Disease), and Juvenile Batten Disease, also known as
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 3 (CLN3 Disease).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; background-color: white">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; background-color: white">Under the terms of the agreement, REGENXBIO
has granted Abeona an exclusive worldwide license (subject to certain non-exclusive rights previously granted for MPS IIIA), with
rights to sublicense, to REGENXBIO&rsquo;s NAV AAV9 vector for the development and commercialization of gene therapies for the
treatment of MPS IIIA, MPS IIIB, CLN1 Disease and CLN3 Disease. In return for these rights, REGENXBIO will receive a guaranteed
$20 million upfront payment, $10 million of which will be paid upon signing and $10 million of which will be paid within 12 months
of the effective date. In addition, REGENXBIO will receive a total of $100 million in annual fees, payable upon the second through
sixth anniversaries of the agreement, $20 million of which is guaranteed. REGENXBIO is also eligible to receive potential commercial
milestone payments of up to $60 million. REGENXBIO will also receive low double-digit royalties on net sales of products incorporating
the licensed intellectual property.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&ldquo;This license agreement further validates the potential
of NAV AAV9 for the treatment of systemic and CNS manifestations of lysosomal storage diseases, as well as the strength of our
intellectual property portfolio,&rdquo; said Kenneth T. Mills, President and Chief Executive Officer of REGENXBIO. &ldquo;We are
pleased to initiate our partnership with Abeona as they continue to advance multiple programs using NAV AAV9 through and towards
clinical trials in indications with significant unmet medical need.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&ldquo;This agreement is an important milestone that underpins
the therapeutic potential we see in our Sanfilippo syndrome and Batten disease programs featuring the NAV AAV9 vector, which have
the potential to transform the lives of patients,&rdquo; said Carsten Thiel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Abeona. &ldquo;Data
from our clinical and preclinical programs and the success of the NAV AAV9 vector observed in other indications strongly positions
the platform as a leading technology for investigational gene therapies for the systemic and CNS manifestations of lysosomal storage
diseases.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Sanfilippo syndrome, or MPS type III, is a group of rare genetic
lysosomal storage diseases with no approved treatments. MPS III is characterized by aggressive behavior, seizures, loss of speech
or vision, an inability to sleep, and premature death. An estimated 70% of children with MPS III do not reach age 18. The underlying
cause of the syndrome is a missing enzyme that is essential to breaking down heparan sulfate. As a result, partially synthesized
heparan sulfate accumulates in the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord, causing progressive damage. MPS
III is categorized by the single gene defects associated with each type of the syndrome - A, B, C or D. The hallmark feature of
MPS IIIA is a deficiency in the SGSH enzyme, while MPS IIIB is distinguished by a marked decrease in NAGLU enzyme activity.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>About Batten Disease</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Infantile and juvenile forms of Batten disease, known as CLN1
and CLN3, are rare autosomal recessive genetic disorders with no approved treatments. Batten disease is fatal, and most do not
live past their twenties or thirties. The underlying cause of the disorder is a deficiency in proteins critical to lysosomal function
that lead to abnormal buildup of lipopigments, and result in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. CLN1 and CLN3 are differentiated
by mutations of their respective genes, yet the first noticeable sign of all forms of Batten disease is often vision impairment
that can progress to blindness. Developmental regression is another hallmark of the disease, as children lose the ability to speak
in complete sentences and to walk or sit, among other manifestations. Later in life, affected children may have recurrent seizures,
heart problems, behavioral problems, and difficulty sleeping.</P>
