means all costs and expenses paid or incurred by Landlord in operating, maintaining, repairing and managing the Building, including,

parking structures, easements, landscaping, property management fees, utility costs to the extent not separately metered, insurance
premiums, depreciation of the costs of replacements or improvements to the Building but not including any Structural Repairs which
are required to be capitalized under GAAP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term &ldquo;Operating Costs&rdquo; does not include:
(i) costs of alterations of tenants&rsquo; premises; (ii) costs of curing construction defects; (iii) interest and principal payments

have accrued. Certain of the costs of management, operation and maintenance of the Building may be common to all of the land and
buildings within the Development owned by Landlord and you consent to Landlord&rsquo;s allocation of such common costs among the
various buildings owned by Landlord within the Development and the amount of such common costs allocated by Landlord to the Building
will be deemed an Operating Cost, provided that the allocation method used by Landlord is reasonable. Landlord may, in a reasonable
manner, allocate insurance premiums for so-called &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; insurance policies which insure other properties as well
as the Building and said allocated amount will be deemed to be an Operating Cost. The inclusion of the improvements, facilities,
and services set forth in this definition does not impose an obligation upon Landlord either to have said improvements or facilities
or to provide those services unless said improvements, facilities or services are already in place at the Development.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">&ldquo;<U>Taxes</U>&rdquo;
means all ad valorem taxes and non ad valorem assessments, or governmental charges levied, assessed or imposed on the Building
including the land on which the Building is comprised and including parking areas and other Common Areas. If at any time during
the term of this Lease the present method of taxation is changed so that in lieu of the whole or any part of any such Taxes, there
will be levied, assessed or imposed on Landlord a capital levy or other tax directly on the rents received therefrom and/or a franchise
tax, assessment, levy or charge measured by or based, in whole or in part, upon such rents for the Building, then all such taxes,
assessments, levies or charges, or the part thereof so measured or based, will be deemed to be included within the term &ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;
for the purposes hereof. The Building is part of a larger tax parcel comprised of the entire Development (Property ID # 5041 23
01 0010) and therefore real property taxes allocated to the Building are an equitable proportion of the real property taxes for
all of the land and improvements included within the tax parcel assessed (the rentable square footage of the Building divided by
the rentable square footage of the Development). If Landlord contests any assessment of Taxes, then the term Taxes includes the
professional fees incurred by Landlord to contest such Taxes. If Landlord prevails in the contest of any assessment of Taxes, Taxes
will nonetheless be determined using the protested amount until such time as the determination of the Value Adjustment Board is
final and non appealable. If the county property appraiser appeals the determination of the Value Adjustment Board, the term &ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;
will include the reasonable costs and fees to defend such suit.</P>
