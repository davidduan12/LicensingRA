Term, Termination and Expiration</B>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.1 Term. This Agreement will become effective as of the Effective Date and will continue
until terminated (the &#147;Effective Period&#148;) according to its terms or until expiration of all
Licensed IP Rights (the &#147;Expiration&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.2 Voluntary Termination By MAKO. MAKO may voluntarily terminate this Agreement upon 30&nbsp;days
written notice to STELKAST and following payment of all sums under Article&nbsp;V hereto, whether such
sums are due before, on or after the effective date of such termination.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.3 Termination for Non-Payment. Subject to Section&nbsp;9.4, failure by MAKO to make timely
payment of any amounts due and owing pursuant to Article&nbsp;IV shall constitute a material breach of
this Agreement and shall, after written notice by STELKAST and failure by MAKO to cure such breach
within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of service of such notice, render the Agreement (and any license granted
hereunder) terminable and voidable by STELKAST in its sole discretion, immediately upon written
notice to MAKO.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.4 Material Breach. Each Party may terminate this Agreement upon a material breach or
default by the other Party of the Agreement by giving notice to breaching party. If the material
breach or default is not cured within 60&nbsp;days, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement
immediately upon notice to the breaching Party..

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.5 Survival. Articles IV, VIII and IX will survive and continue after termination of this
Agreement. Any amounts due under Articles V prior to termination will remain due and become
immediately payable upon termination. Upon termination prior to Expiration, MAKO must stop all use
of all Licensed Technical Information, except, however, that MAKO may retain and continue to use
the Licensed Technical Information for solely for purposes of supporting use of the Implant as sold
or distributed prior to termination. MAKO may also sell any inventory of the Implant ordered or on
hand prior to termination. For the avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement does not
affect the sale of the Implant purchased from STELKAST for resale by MAKO.

shall not be assignable by MAKO absent the written consent of STELKAST, except that no such consent
will be required for succession by merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the
assets, or change of control of MAKO, but only if the assignee, successor or surviving entity
agrees to be bound in writing to all of its terms and conditions. This Agreement will be binding
on successors in interest and permitted assigns. An assignment other than as expressly permitted
by this Section&nbsp;10.1 will be void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

however, that, if any such change will materially diminish the practical realization of the
benefits intended to be conferred to any Party to this Agreement, such Party may terminate this

other Party to this Agreement will not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary consent to or
approval of any subsequent similar act. Subsequent acceptance by a Party to this Agreement of any
performance due to it under this Agreement will not be deemed to be a waiver by such first Party of
any preceding breach by any other Party of any terms, provisions, covenants, or conditions of this
Agreement. No act or conduct of or by MAKO under this Agreement, including any payment of a
royalty, shall be evidence, or deemed an admission or suggestion, that any product manufactured,
licensed, or distributed by MAKO infringes the Licensed IP Rights or any other intellectual
property right.

failure of its performance under this Agreement if such delay or failure arises by any reason
beyond its reasonable control, including any act of God, any acts of the common enemy, the
elements, earthquakes, floods, fires, epidemics, riots, failures or delay in transportation or
communications, or any act or failure to act by the other Party or such other Party&#146;s employees,
agents, or independent contractors or representatives; provided, however, that lack of funds will
not be deemed to be a reason beyond a Party&#146;s reasonable control. The Parties will promptly inform
and consult with each other as to any of the above causes that, in their judgment, may or could be
the cause of a delay in the performance of this Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In the event that, after reasonable consultation, but within 30&nbsp;days, the Parties
are unable to reach agreement, any claim or controversy shall be settled by arbitration
administered by the American Arbitration Association under its then current Commercial
Arbitration Rules, before a single arbitrator and judgment on any award rendered by or
finding of the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
arbitrator shall have the authority to award actual money damages (with interest on unpaid
amounts from the date due), temporary injunctive relief, and reasonable attorney&#146;s fees and
expenses, but, the arbitrator shall not have the authority to award exemplary or punitive
damages, and the Parties expressly waive any claimed right to such damages. The costs of
arbitration shall be borne by the Parties in accordance with the award of the arbitrator.
If a Party fails to proceed with arbitration, unsuccessfully challenges the arbitration
award, or fails to comply with the arbitration award, the other Party is entitled to costs,
including reasonable attorney&#146;s fees, for having to compel arbitration or defend or enforce
the award. Except as otherwise required by law, the Parties agree to maintain and to cause
the arbitrator to maintain as confidential all information, documents and other data of any
kind or nature whatsoever obtained during the arbitration process, including the fact that
such arbitration is being undertaken and the final award of the arbitrator.

provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement shall not affect the
Parties<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#146;</SUP> obligations under the Supply Agreement. Neither of the Parties shall be bound
by any warranties, understandings or representations with respect to such subject matter other

relationship between the Parties or otherwise to create any liability for either Party whatsoever
with respect to the indebtedness, liabilities, and obligations of the other Party.

effect as if all signing Parties had signed the same document. All counterparts will be construed
together and evidence only one agreement, which, notwithstanding the actual date of execution of
any counterpart, will be deemed to be dated the day and year first written above. In making proof
of this Agreement, it will not be necessary to account for a counterpart executed by any Party
other than the Party against whom enforcement is sought or to account for more than one
counterpart executed by the Party against whom enforcement is sought.
