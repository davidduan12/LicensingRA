promptness notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of and
specific basis for such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the
extent then feasible (which estimate will not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim and
demand (the &#147;<U>Claim Notice</U>&#148;)). The Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify
such Indemnified Party with respect to any such claim or demand to the extent the failure of such
Indemnified Party to promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such a claim or demand materially
prejudices the Indemnifying Party&#146;s ability to defend against the claim or demand. The
Indemnifying Party will have 30&nbsp;days from the personal delivery or mailing of the Claim Notice (the
&#147;<U>Notice Period</U>&#148;) to notify such Indemnified Party (i)&nbsp;whether or not it disputes
the liability of the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such

Party, to defend such Indemnified Party against such claim or demand; provided, however, that such
Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice Period to file any motion,
answer or other pleading which it deems necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those
of the Indemnifying Party and not materially prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party notifies such Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it
desires to defend such Indemnified Party against such claim or demand, except as hereinafter
provided, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend by all appropriate proceedings. If
such Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement
it may do so at its sole cost and expense. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, such
Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any
claim or demand which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, and, if appropriate and related to
the claim in question, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the third party
claim or demand, or any cross-complaint against any person. No claim may be settled by the
Indemnifying Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with a Third Party Claim

other condition, covenant, term, or provision), and (c)&nbsp;for the specific instance(s)

obligations imposed on it in Articles 2 and 3 are special, unique, and of extraordinary character.
Accordingly, each Party to this Agreement agrees and declares that it is impossible to measure in
money the damages that will accrue by reason of its failure to perform any of its obligations under
Articles 2 and 3 and that, in the event of breach by it of any such obligation, the remedy at law
for such breach will be inadequate. Therefore, each Party to this Agreement, by execution of this
Agreement, waives the claim or defense that there is an adequate remedy at law and agrees it will
not urge in any action or proceeding to which it is a party that relates to Articles 2 and 3 the
claim or defense that such remedy at law exists. Furthermore, the parties, by execution of this
Agreement, agree that each other Party is entitled (without proving damages or posting bond) to
equitable remedies, including specific performance and injunctive relief (in addition to damages)
as a remedy for the enforcement of Articles 2 and 3.

Neither of the Parties shall be bound by any warranties, understandings or representations with
respect to such subject matter other than as expressly provided herein or in a writing signed with

herein, will be deemed or construed to create a partnership, joint venture, other form of business
enterprise or association or cooperative arrangement, agency relationship, or franchise
relationship between the Parties or otherwise to create any liability for either Party whatsoever
with respect to the indebtedness, liabilities, and obligations of the other Party.
