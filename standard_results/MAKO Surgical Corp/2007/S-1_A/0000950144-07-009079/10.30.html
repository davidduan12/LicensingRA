against any and all Damages resulting from (a)&nbsp;any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.1 <U>Confidentiality of Agreement</U>. The terms, but not the existence, of this Agreement

neither Party may disclose such terms to any third party without the prior written consent of&#146; the
other Party, except as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Each Party may (i)&nbsp;disclose this Agreement and its terms to potential acquirers of,
investors in or lenders to such Party (including any representatives of the Parties in such
transaction), or disclosures reasonably necessary in connection with the divestiture,
merger, transfer or sale of all or any portion of a Party&#146;s respective businesses, but only
if such disclosure is made pursuant to a written confidentiality agreement binding upon such
potential acquirer, investor, lender or other party, which obligates such party not to
disclose and to take reasonable precautions against unauthorized disclosure of the Agreement
and its terms; (ii)&nbsp;disclose this Agreement and its terms in any arbitration, mediation or
other official dispute resolution procedure pursuant to a written confidentiality agreement
binding upon the parties, which obligates such parties not to disclose and to take
reasonable precautions against unauthorized disclosure of the Agreement and its terms; (iii)
disclose this Agreement and its terms to its professional advisors who are under an ethical
obligation of confidentiality in order to comply with, or determine compliance with, any
law, rule, regulation, or accounting or similar requirement; and (iv)&nbsp;disclose this
Agreement and its terms, in response to a judicial or governmental request, requirement or
order, or as required by law, including any securities laws, on the condition that such
Party provides the other Party with sufficient prior notice in order to contest such
request, requirement or order or seek protective measures.

Agreement absent the written consent of the other Party, except that no such consent will be
required for succession by merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets,
or change of control, but only if the assignee, successor or surviving entity agrees to be bound
in writing to all of its terms and conditions. This Agreement will be binding on successors in
interest and permitted assigns. An assignment other than as expressly permitted by this Section
9.2 will be void and shall constitute a breach of this Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.6 <U>No Strict Construction</U>. This Agreement is the result of substantial negotiations
among the Parties and their counsel and has been prepared by their joint efforts. Accordingly,
the fact that counsel to one Party or another may have drafted this Agreement or any portion of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.7 <U>Severability and Reformation</U>. Wherever possible, each provision of this

and enforceable; provided, however, that, if any such change will materially diminish the
