Broward County, Florida. Your obligation to pay Rent and any additional rent under this Lease is
not based in any way on the income or profits derived from the Premises. If a Succession (as
defined in Section&nbsp;18.03) occurs, and if the Superior Mortgagee is advised by its counsel that all
or a portion of the Rent or additional rent payable under this Lease is or may be deemed to be
unrelated business income within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from
time to time, as in effect at that time (the &#147;Code&#148;), or within the meaning of U.S. Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code, the Superior Mortgagee may elect to amend unilaterally the
calculation of the Rent or additional rent, and you agree to execute such amendment, so that none
of the Rent or additional rent payable to the Superior Mortgagee under the Lease will constitute
unrelated business income provided that such amendment may not increase your payment obligations or
other liability under the Lease or reduce Landlord&#146;s obligations under this Lease.

INSURANCE
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of this Lease, Landlord and you shall carry and maintain the following types
of insurance and in the amounts specified in this Article, all as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.01 <U>Fire and Casualty Damage</U>. Landlord agrees to maintain insurance covering the
Building in an amount not less than full insurable value (subject to any applicable deductible)
insuring against loss or damage by fire and other hazards included within the term &#147;special causes
of loss&#148;, &#147;all risk&#148; or &#147;extended coverage&#148; and against such other hazards as Landlord may deem
advisable or which a Superior Mortgagee requires. Such insurance will not, however, insure your
personal property. Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 13.01(c) below, such insurance shall
be for the sole benefit of Landlord and under its sole control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.02 <U>Personal Property</U>. You shall procure and maintain throughout the term of this

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.03 <U>Tenant&#146;s Liability Insurance</U>. You shall procure and maintain throughout the
term of the Lease a policy or policies of insurance, at your sole cost and expense, insuring both
Landlord and you (and, if requested by Landlord, insuring the Superior Mortgagee) against all
claims, demands or actions arising out of or in connection with: (i)&nbsp;the Premises; (ii)&nbsp;the
condition of the Premises; (iii)&nbsp;your operations in and maintenance and use of the Premises; and
(iv)&nbsp;your liability assumed under this Lease, the limits of such policy or policies to be in the
amount of not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence in respect to injury to persons (including
death), and in the amount of not less than $250,000 per occurrence in respect to property damage or
destruction, including loss of use thereof. If Landlord has also obtained comprehensive liability
insurance, then the insurance required to be maintained by you pursuant to this Section shall be
primary and non contributing with respect to any policies carried by Landlord and any coverage
carried by Landlord shall be excess insurance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.05 <U>Proof of Insurance</U>. Insurance required to be procured and maintained by you
pursuant to this Article shall be procured by you from responsible insurance companies reasonably
satisfactory to Landlord. Certificate(s) of insurance reasonably acceptable to Landlord evidencing
your compliance with the provisions of Sections&nbsp;12.02, 12.03 and 12.04 shall be delivered to
Landlord prior to the Commencement Date. Not less than fifteen (15)&nbsp;days prior to the expiration
date of any such policies, updated certificate(s) of insurance shall be delivered to Landlord.
Such policies shall further provide that not less than thirty (30)&nbsp;days written notice shall be
given to Landlord before such policy may be canceled or changed to reduce insurance provided
thereby.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.06 <U>Waiver of Claims</U>. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Landlord and you each
hereby waives any claim against the other which is insurable under the property insurance required
to be carried under Sections&nbsp;12.01 and 12.02 of this Lease, irrespective of whether Landlord or you
actually maintains such insurance. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the damage or destruction to
the Building was caused by your negligence, then you agree, upon demand, to reimburse Landlord for
the deductible expended by Landlord under Landlord&#146;s policy of insurance (but not in excess of
$20,000) to repair or rebuild the Building or part thereof after such damage or destruction. You
and the Landlord each agree to request the insurance carriers to include in the policies of
property insurance required to be carried under Sections&nbsp;12.01 and 12.02 of this Lease, a waiver of
subrogation provision consistent with the foregoing waiver of claims.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.01 <U>Damage or Destruction</U>. (a)&nbsp;If the Building should be totally destroyed by fire,
tornado or other casualty, or if the Building should be so damaged thereby that rebuilding or
repairs cannot in Landlord&#146;s reasonable estimation be completed within the Restoration Period, this
Lease shall terminate and the Rent shall be abated during the unexpired portion of this Lease,

shall at its sole cost and expense thereupon proceed with reasonable diligence to rebuild and
repair the Building to substantially the condition in which it existed prior to such damage
(including damage to plate glass caused by a windstorm), except that Landlord shall not be required
to rebuild, repair or replace any part of the partitions, fixtures, additions and other
improvements which may have been placed in, on or about the Premises by you except that Landlord
may elect not to rebuild if such damage occurs during the last year of the term of the Lease
exclusive of any option which is unexercised at the time of such damage. If the Premises are
untenantable in whole or in part following such damage, the Rent payable hereunder during the
period in which they are untenantable shall be reduced to such extent as may be fair and reasonable
under all of the circumstances. If Landlord should fail to complete the repairs and rebuilding
within the Restoration Period, you may, at your option, terminate this Lease by delivering written
notice of termination to Landlord as your exclusive remedy, whereupon all rights and or obligations
hereunder shall cease and terminate. Should construction be delayed because of a Force Majeure
Event, the Restoration Period shall be extended for the time Landlord is so delayed.

insurance proceeds be applied to the indebtedness secured by a mortgage encumbering the Building,
then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease by delivering written notice of
termination to you within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after such requirement is made by the Superior
Mortgagee, whereupon all rights and obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate.

effective when the legal taking or private purchase in lieu thereof shall occur. If less than the
whole or less than a substantial part of the Premises or Building is thus taken or sold, Landlord
may nonetheless terminate this Lease by giving written notice to you in which event this Lease
shall terminate effective when the legal taking or private purchase in lieu thereof shall occur.
If this Lease is not terminated upon such taking or private sale in lieu thereof, the Rent payable
hereunder during the unexpired portion of this Lease shall be reduced to such extent as may be fair

to a condition suitable for your use, as near to the condition thereof immediately prior to such
taking as is reasonably feasible under all the circumstances. All amounts awarded

employees, agents, patrons or visitors, or to any other person whomsoever, for any injury to person
or damage to property on or about the Premises, resulting from and/or caused in part or whole by
your negligence or misconduct or by the negligence or misconduct of your agents, servants or
employees or any other person entering upon the Premises, or caused by the buildings and
improvements located on the Premises becoming out of repair, or caused by leakage of gas, oil,
water or steam or by electricity emanating from the Premises, or due to the existence of mold or
mildew, or due to any cause whatsoever other than the grossly negligent or intentional acts of
Landlord, and you hereby covenant and agree that you will at all times indemnify and hold safe and
harmless the Building, the Landlord, Landlord&#146;s agents and employees from any loss, liability,
claims, suits, costs, expenses, including without limitation attorney&#146;s fees and damages, both real
and alleged, arising out of any such damage or injury; except injury to persons or damage to
property the sole cause of which is the gross negligence of Landlord or the failure of Landlord to
repair any part of the Building which Landlord is obligated to repair and maintain hereunder within
a reasonable time after the receipt of written notice from you of needed repairs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.02 <U>Tenant Remedies</U>. In the event of any default by Landlord, your exclusive remedy
shall be an action for damages or for specific performance or other injunctive relief if specific
performance or injunctive relief is a commercially reasonable remedy given the circumstances, but
prior to any such action you must give Landlord written notice specifying such default with
particularity, and Landlord shall thereupon have thirty (30)&nbsp;days in which to commence to cure such
default and proceed diligently thereafter to cure such default. Unless and until Landlord fails to
commence to cure such default within such thirty (30)&nbsp;day period and to proceed diligently
thereafter to cure such default, you shall not have any remedy or cause of action by reason
thereof.

default you shall recover a money judgment against Landlord, such judgment shall be satisfied only
out of the proceeds of sale received upon execution of such judgment and levied thereon against the
right, title and interest of Landlord in the Building and out of the rents or other income from the
Building receivable by Landlord, or out of the consideration received by Landlord from the sale or
other disposition of all or any part of Landlord&#146;s right, title and interest in the Building,
including insurance and condemnation proceeds, subject, nevertheless, to the rights of a Superior
Mortgagee, and neither Landlord nor any of the stockholders, partners or members comprising the
entity which is Landlord herein shall be liable for any deficiency.

to Landlord elsewhere in this Lease or at law or in equity, Landlord shall have the following
rights and remedies:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.01 <U>Retake Possession of the Premises and or Termination</U>. Upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default, Landlord shall have the immediate right to reenter the Premises, either by
summary proceedings or without summary proceedings if such reentry can be done peaceably, and to
disposes you and all other occupants from the Premises and remove and dispose of all property
situated within the Premises, or at Landlord&#146;s election, to store such property in a public
warehouse or elsewhere at your cost and for your account, all without any service of notice of
intention to reenter and with or without resort to legal process (which requirement of legal
process is hereby waived by you as long as such reentry can be done peaceably) and without Landlord
being deemed guilty of trespass or becoming liable for any loss or damage which may be occasioned
thereby. Upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default, Landlord shall also have the right, at
its option, in addition to and not in limitation of any other right or remedy available under this
Lease or at law or in equity, to terminate this Lease by giving you notice of cancellation and upon
the mailing of such notice, this Lease and the Term shall end and expire as fully and completely as

Premises, Landlord shall have the immediate right of reentry in the manner aforesaid, and you and
all other occupants shall quit and surrender the Premises to Landlord but you shall remain liable
to Landlord as set forth herein. No reentry or taking possession of the Premises or acceptance of
keys to the Premises voluntarily given by you following an Event of Default, shall be construed as
an election on the part of Landlord to terminate this Lease unless written notice of such intention
be given by Landlord to you or unless the termination thereof shall result as a matter of law or be
decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any retaking of possession for your
account or reletting for your account, Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this
Lease.

the Term, or if you are ejected, dispossessed, or removed from the Premises by summary proceedings
or in any other manner as a result of an Event of Default, Landlord at any time thereafter may
relet all or a part of the Premises, either in the name of Landlord or as agent for you, for a term
or terms which, at Landlord&#146;s option may be less than or exceed the period of the remainder of the
Term or which otherwise would have constituted the balance of the Term had such Term not been
sooner terminated and grant concessions and free Rent. Landlord shall in no event be liable in any
way for Landlord&#146;s failure to relet the Premises or to collect any rent receivable from such
reletting. Landlord is hereby authorized and empowered to make such repairs, alterations,
subdivisions or other preparations for the reletting of the Premises as Landlord deems fit,
advisable and necessary, without in any way releasing you from any liability hereunder. Landlord
shall receive the rents from such reletting and apply the same, first, to the payment of any
monetary obligation due under this Lease other than Rent, second to the payment

rent that accrues up until the time that Landlord regains possession of the Premises, you shall be
liable for and shall pay to Landlord as damages any deficiency between the Rent reserved herein and
the net rents received by Landlord from reletting, if any, for each month of the period which
otherwise would have constituted the balance of the Term. You shall pay such deficiency on an
accelerated basis as provided for herein or, at Landlord&#146;s sole option, in monthly installments on
the due date for such Rent installment as specified in this Lease, and any suit or proceeding
brought to collect the deficiency for any month, either during the Term or after any termination
thereof, shall not prejudice or preclude in any way the rights of Landlord to collect the
deficiency for any subsequent month by a similar suit or proceeding. Unless Landlord elects to
forego the acceleration of Rent, accelerated Rent shall be calculated as the present value of the
Rent due for the remainder of the Term, or, in the case of a termination, which would have been due
for the remainder of the Term had such Term not been sooner terminated as a result of the Event of
Default. For these purposes, the discount rate to be used for purposes of calculating the present
value shall be the average rate established and announced for United States Treasury Bills, with a
maturity of thirteen weeks at the four weekly auctions held immediately prior to the date that
Landlord obtained possession of the Premises. Landlord shall, however, account to you for the net
rents received by Landlord from reletting on a monthly basis only if you have paid to Landlord the
damages recoverable by Landlord from you as provided for herein and only to the extent of such
payments.

the right to enter upon the Premises, without being liable for prosecution or any claim for damages
therefore, and do whatever you were obligated to do under the terms of this Lease to cure the Event
of Default, and you agree to reimburse Landlord on demand for any expenses which Landlord may incur
in thus effecting compliance with your obligations under this Lease, and you further agree that
Landlord shall not be liable for any damages resulting to you from such action, whether caused by
the negligence of Landlord or otherwise.

as when such installment is due, or if you fail to pay any additional rent or any other payment
required to be made by you to Landlord hereunder, then to help defray the additional cost to
Landlord for processing such late payment, you agree to pay to Landlord a late charge in an amount
equal to five (5%) percent of such installment or payment. The provision for such late charge
shall be in addition to all of Landlord&#146;s other rights and remedies hereunder or at law and shall
not be construed as liquidated damages or as limiting Landlord&#146;s remedies in any manner. If your
check, given to Landlord in payment, is returned by the bank for non-payment, you agree to pay all
expenses incurred by Landlord as a result thereof.

encumbrance of any kind or nature whatsoever upon, or in any manner to bind the interests of
Landlord in the Premises or to charge the rentals payable hereunder for any claim in favor of any
person dealing with you, including those who may furnish materials or perform labor for any
construction or repairs and nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed as a consent on the
part of the Landlord to subject the estate of the Landlord to liability under the Construction Lien
Law of the State of Florida, it being expressly understood that the Landlord&#146;s estate shall not be
subject to liens for improvements made by you and each such claim shall affect and each such lien
shall attach to, if at all, only the leasehold interest granted to you by this instrument. You
covenant and agree that you will pay or cause to be paid all sums legally due and payable by you on
account of any labor performed or materials furnished in connection with any work performed on the
Premises on which any lien is or can be validly and legally asserted against its leasehold interest
in the Premises or the improvements thereon and that you will save and hold Landlord harmless from
any and all loss, cost or expense based on or arising out of asserted claims or liens against the
leasehold estate or against the right, title and interest of the Landlord in the Premises or under
the terms of this Lease. You agree to give Landlord immediate written notice if any lien or
encumbrance is placed on the Premises.

repairs or reconstruction of or to the Premises, you and the Landlord each agree and confirm that:
(i)&nbsp;Landlord has not consented nor will Landlord ever consent to the furnishing of any labor or
materials to the Premises that would or may result in any mechanic&#146;s or materialman&#146;s lien
attaching to Landlord&#146;s interest in the Premises; (ii)&nbsp;you are not the agent of Landlord for the
purposes of any such improvements, additions, alterations, repairs or reconstruction; and (iii)
except as expressly provided herein, Landlord has retained no control over the manner in which any
such improvements, additions, alterations, repairs or reconstruction are accomplished, and has made
no agreement to make or be responsible for any payment to or for the benefit of any person
furnishing labor or materials in connection therewith. No one furnishing labor or materials to or
for your account shall be entitled to claim any lien against the interest of Landlord in the
Premises and such entities shall look solely to you and your leasehold interest under this Lease
for the satisfaction of any such claims.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall be liable for all taxes levied or assessed against personal property, furniture or
fixtures placed by you in the Premises. If any such taxes for which you are liable are levied or
assessed against Landlord or Landlord&#146;s property and if Landlord elects to pay the same or if the
assessed value of Landlord&#146;s property is increased by inclusion of personal property, furniture or
fixtures placed by you in the Premises, and Landlord elects to pay the taxes based on such
increase, you shall pay to Landlord upon demand that part of such taxes.
