reject the shipment within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of receipt together with a written indication of the
reasons for such possible rejection, and (ii)&nbsp;as promptly as reasonably possible thereafter,
provide STELKAST with notice of final rejection and the full basis therefore. After notice of
intent to reject is given, MAKO shall cooperate with STELKAST in determining whether rejection is
necessary or justified. If no such notice of intent to reject is timely received, MAKO shall be
deemed to have accepted such delivery of Product. However, in the case of Products having latent
defects which upon diligent examination by MAKO upon receipt could not have been discovered, MAKO
must give notice of MAKO&#146;s intent to reject within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after discovery of such
defects.

entitled to a refund of the purchase price (together with insurance and freight charges) of
properly rejected Products at the time they are ultimately rejected, provided that if STELKAST
disputes the rejection, refund shall be made, if at all, at the time the dispute is finally
resolved. STELKAST shall notify MAKO as promptly as reasonably possible whether it accepts MAKO&#146;s
basis for any rejection.

notice of rejection, STELKAST shall use its reasonable efforts, at MAKO&#146;s request, to provide
replacement Product which shall be purchased by MAKO as provided in this Agreement.

no other matter), and (c)&nbsp;for the specific instance(s) expressly set forth in such consent or

condition, covenant, term, or provision expressly made the subject to such waiver (and no other

in such waiver (and no earlier or subsequent instances). Without limiting the foregoing sentence,
none of the following will constitute a waiver of the rights of a Party to this Agreement to demand
exact compliance with the conditions, covenants, terms, and provisions of
this Agreement: (a)&nbsp;a failure of such Party to exercise any power reserved to it in this

are unable to reach agreement, any claim or controversy shall be settled by arbitration
administered by the American Arbitration Association under its then current Commercial
Arbitration Rules, before a single arbitrator and judgment on any award rendered by or
finding of the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
arbitrator shall have the authority to award actual money damages (with interest on unpaid

expenses, but the arbitrator shall not have the authority to award exemplary or punitive
damages, and the Parties expressly waive any claimed right to such damages. The costs of
arbitration shall be borne by the Parties in accordance
with the award of the arbitrator. If a Party fails to proceed with arbitration,
unsuccessfully challenges the arbitration award, or fails to comply with the arbitration
award, the other Party is entitled to costs, including reasonable attorney&#146;s fees, for
